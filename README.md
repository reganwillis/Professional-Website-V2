# Professional-Website-V2

Version 2 of my professional website ([see version 1](https://github.com/reganwillis/Professional-Website-V1)) is hosted at http://reganwillis-softwaredeveloper.com/ and can also be accessed at reganwillis.com.

This is a simple HTML/CSS website that holds information about me as a programmer including bios, my resume, and some technical writing that I've done. I also provides links to connect with me.
