# Professional-Website-V2

Version 2 of my professional website ([see version 1](https://github.com/reganwillis/Professional-Website-V1)) (will be) hosted at http://reganwillis-softwaredeveloper.com/.

This is a simple HTML/CSS website that holds information about me as a programmer including my bio, my resume, and my portfolio. I also provides links to connect with me.
